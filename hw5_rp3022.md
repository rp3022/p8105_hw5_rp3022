``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## problem 2

Importing the raw homicides dataset:

``` r
library (readr)

urlfile="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicide_raw <-read_csv(url(urlfile)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

#### Raw dataset description:

The dataset contains data of criminal homicides over the past decade in
50 American cities.

-   The total number of observations are **52179** and the total number
    of variables are **12**
-   It includes variables **uid, reported_date, victim_last,
    victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city, state, lat,
    lon, disposition**.

#### Data wrangling and tidying the dataset

``` r
homicide = homicide_raw %>%
unite('city_state',"city":"state", remove = FALSE)%>%
  select(-city,-state)%>%
   mutate (homi_type = case_when (disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Unsolved", 
                                  disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "Unsolved", 
                                  disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "Solved" )) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  filter (city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>%
  count(homi_type) %>%
  spread(key = homi_type, value = n)%>%
  mutate (total = Solved + Unsolved) %>%
  select (-Solved)
```
